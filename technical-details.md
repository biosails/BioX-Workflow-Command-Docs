# Technical Details

BioX is written in perl, using the wonderful [MooseX-App](https://metacpan.org/release/MooseX-App). It is built with a pluggable architecture and can be easily extended with custom plugins and libraries.

BioX can be installed through cpanm or conda. The recommended method of installing absolutely everything is conda.

```
#Perl only solution
cpanm BioX::Workflow::Command

#Conda
conda install -c nyuad-cgsb perl-biox-workflow-command
```
